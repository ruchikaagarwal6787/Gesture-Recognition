# Gesture Recognition Project

This project implements a gesture recognition system using a pre-trained MobileNet model combined with a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) layer. The system is trained to recognize 15 different gestures.

## Project Overview

The core of this project is a deep learning model that leverages the feature extraction capabilities of MobileNet and the sequential processing ability of GRUs. The model is trained on a dataset of gesture sequences and is capable of classifying new, unseen gesture sequences into one of the 15 defined gesture categories.

## Dependencies

Before running the code, you need to install the following libraries:

*   TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training the neural network.
*   NumPy: For numerical operations.
*   OpenCV: For video processing and capturing (if you are processing videos).
*   Other common data science libraries (like pandas) can also be useful.
